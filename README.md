# PLUX Unity API \[Windows] | Sample APP
The **Sample APP** contained inside this repository provides a practical and intuitive resource to explore the integration of the signal acquisition devices
commercialized by **PLUX** ([**biosignalsplux**](https://www.biosignalsplux.com/en/):warning:, [**BITalino**](https://bitalino.com/en/)...) with the powerful 
development environment of **Unity**.

> :warning: **Note:** Despite being part of the **biosignalsplux** family, the [**fNIRS Explorer**](https://plux.info/biosignalsplux-wearables/497-fnirs-explorer-820201221.html) is not currently supported by the **Unity API**. Compatibility issues will be solved in a short-future!

Some questions can be enlightened, such as:

+	How PLUX acquisition systems can be searched and found on the user's computer?
+	How to pair a computer with a PLUX device?
+	How to customize signal acquisition parameters, such as sampling rate and Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) resolution?
+	How to start a real-time acquisition?
+	How to collect and store the acquired real-time physiological data?
+	How to stop the real-time acquisition?

## Supported Platforms

+	Microsoft Windows \[32 and 64 bits]

## Tested Script Runtime Versions

+	Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5
+	Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0

## Limitations

+	Currently, **Bluetooth Low Energy** (BLE) devices are supported by the **Sample APP**, however, you should use the approved [**BLE dongle D 112**](https://plux.info/accessories/207-bitalino-proven-ble-dongle-810121502.html?search_query=ble+dongle&results=38).

## How to Easily Integrate the API in your Unity Project?
1.	Copy the **plux_unity_interface.dll** to the **Plugins** folder of your Unity project. The location of this file will depend on the desired Operating System Architecture (x86 or x86_64): `plux-api-unity-sample/Assets/Plugins/x86/plux_unity_interface.dll` **\[32 bits]** or `plux-api-unity-sample/Assets/Plugins/x86_64/plux_unity_interface.dll` **\[64 bits]**
2.	Copy the **PluxDeviceManager** folder (a C\# interface to PLUX API) to the **Scripts** folder of your Unity project. In this case the directory location is: `plux-api-unity-sample/Assets/Scripts/PluxDeviceManager`

> **WARNING**
>
> While initialising **PluxDeviceManager** instance/object it will be necessary to specify a callback responsible for dealing with the asynchronous results produced during the Bluetooth device scan and another one that flags when a successful Bluetooth connection is established. The callbacks should present the following structure:
>
> **Scanning Results**
>
> `public void ScanResults(List<string> listDevices)`
>
> **Connection Successful**
>
> `public void ConnectionDone()`

After the previous two steps, you will be fully prepared to expand your Unity project and include some interesting functionalities through the use of **PLUX** signal acquisition devices.

For this purpose, you simply need to invoke the available [Methods](#Methods).

## PluxDev

Method used to establish a connection between **PLUX** devices and computer. Behaves like an object constructor.
```csharp
void PluxDev(string macAddress)
```

### Description

With `PluxDev` method it is possible to establish a **Bluetooth** connection between a computer and a **PLUX** Device. To ensure a successful pairing, the user only need to check the device mac-address (attached to the **BITalino** board, **biosignalsplux** hub...).
This mac-address should be inserted in a string format with the following structure: `"00:07:80:4D:2E:AD"` (6 pairs of characters separated by ":").

### Parameters

+	**macAddress** `string`: Device unique identifier, consisting in a string formed by 6 pairs of characters separated by ":" symbol (total of 17 characters).

## DisconnectPluxDev

Opposing to [PluxDev](#PluxDev), this method is very useful when you want to safely cut the connection between **PLUX** devices and computer. Behaves like an object destructor.
```csharp
void DisconnectPluxDev()
```

### Description

Through `DisconnectPluxDev` method the established connection between a **PLUX** device and a personal computer can be securely closed. If a real-time acquisition is yet being executed, a stop command is automatically sent, ensuring the end of communication loop.
Internally, the object created with `PluxDev` is destroyed after invoking `DisconnectPluxDev`.

### Parameters

*Function without input parameters*

## StartAcquisitionUnity

Class method used to start a real-time acquisition at the device paired with the computer through `PluxDev` method.
```csharp
void StartAcquisitionUnity(int samplingRate, List<int> listChannels, int resolution)
```

### Description

The current API version supports real-time acquisitions with analogical sensors, however, to communicate with computer the **PLUX** device needs to execute an **Analogical to Digital Conversion** (ADC), through data sampling.
Taking ADC stage into consideration, while starting a real-time acquisition, selecting a specific sampling rate and resolution is extremely easy through the inputs of `StartAcquisitionUnity`.

### Parameters

+	**samplingRate** `int`: Desired sampling rate that will be used during the data acquisition stage. The used units are in Hz (samples/s).
+	**listChannels** `List<int>`: A list where it can be specified the active channels. Each entry contains a port number of an active channel.
+	**resolution** `int`: Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) resolution. This parameter defines how precise are the digital sampled values when compared with the ideal real case scenario.

## StartAcquisitionByNbrUnity

Class method used to start a real-time acquisition at the device paired with `PluxDev` method.
```csharp
void StartAcquisitionByNbrUnity(int samplingRate, int numberOfChannel, int resolution)
```

### Description

The current API version supports real-time acquisitions with analogical sensors, however, to communicate with computer the **PLUX** device needs to execute an **Analogical to Digital Conversion** (ADC), through data sampling.
Taking ADC stage into consideration, while starting a real-time acquisition, selecting a specific sampling rate and resolution is extremely easy through the inputs of `StartAcquisitionByNbrUnity`.
The main difference of this function in comparison with `StartAcquisitionUnity` is the `numberOfChannels` argument, so, instead of specifying a list of active channels you can simply identify the number of channels to be used during the data collection procedure.
Channels are activated in a sequential way, so, if `numberOfChannels` is equal to 3 it means that ports 1 to 3 will collect data.

### Parameters

+	**samplingRate** `int`: Desired sampling rate that will be used during the data acquisition stage. The used units are in Hz (samples/s).
+	**numberOfChannels** `int`: Number of the active channel that will be used during data acquisition. With **BITalino** this value should be between 1 and 6 while for **biosignalsplux** it is possible to collect data from up to 8 channels (simultaneously).
+	**resolution** `int`: Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) resolution. This parameter defines how precise are the digital sampled values when compared with the ideal real case scenario.

## StartAcquisitionMuscleBanUnity

Class method used to start a real-time acquisition at the device paired with `PluxDev` method (on **muscleBAN**).
```csharp
void StartAcquisitionMuscleBanUnity(int samplingRate, List<int> listChannels, int resolution, int freqDivisor)
```

### Description

The current API version supports real-time acquisitions with analogical sensors, however, to communicate with computer the **PLUX** device needs to execute an **Analogical to Digital Conversion** (ADC), through data sampling.
Taking ADC stage into consideration, while starting a real-time acquisition, selecting a specific sampling rate and resolution is extremely easy through the inputs of `StartAcquisitionMuscleBanUnity`.
The main difference on the inputs of this function in comparison with `StartAcquisitionUnity`, is the additional `freqDivisor` argument, that transmits the information regarding the subsampling level to be applied during the **muscleBAN** data acquisition.

### Parameters

+	**samplingRate** `int`: Desired sampling rate that will be used during the data acquisition stage. The used units are in Hz (samples/s).
+	**listChannels** `List<int>`: A list where it can be specified the active channels. Each entry contains a port number of an active channel.
+	**resolution** `int`: Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) resolution. This parameter defines how precise are the digital sampled values when compared with the ideal real case scenario.
+	**freqDivisor** `int`: Frequency divisor, i.e., acquired data will be subsampled accordingly to this parameter. If freqDivisor = 10, it means that each set of 10 acquired samples will trigger the communication of a single sample (through the communication loop).

## StopAcquisitionUnity

Class method used to interrupt the real-time communication loop triggered by `StartAcquisitionUnity()`, `StartAcquisitionByNbrUnity()` or `StartAcquisitionMuscleBanUnity()` methods.
```csharp
bool StopAcquisitionUnity(int forceStop=0)
```

### Description

After starting a real-time acquisition a communication loop between the PLUX device and the computer starts running on a parallel thread.
With `StopAcquisitionUnity()` function, first of all, the communication loop is interrupted, task followed by the stop of  the real-time acquisition and finally the thread closure.

### Parameters

+	**forceStop** `int`: Integer code identifying the cause of acquisition stop (>= 0 | manually invoked by the user; -1 | device turned off; -2 | communication timeout exceeded).

### Returned Values

A `bool` flag is returned identifying when the stop event was forced (**true**) or manually invoked by the user (**false**).

## GetPackageOfData [v1]

Class method intended to request a package of data collected by the **PLUX** device.

```csharp
int[] GetPackageOfData(int channelNbr, List<int> activeChannelsMask, bool rebootMemory)
```

### Description

After triggering the start of a real-time data acquisition streaming of sample values is continuously guaranteed through the established **Bluetooth** communication.

The **PluxDeviceManager** class ensures the storage of the received packages of data, being this getter the method used to access the all packages of data from a desired channel (**channelNbr**). 

### Parameters

+	**channelNbr** `int`: Number of the channel under analysis (from which the sample will be retrieved).
+	**activeChannelsMask** `List<int>`: List containing set of active channels.
+	**rebootMemory** `bool`: When **true** the stored data inside **BufferedSamples** object is re-initialized.

### Returned Values

An ordered array of integer values, where each entry contains a sample value acquired from the **channelNbr** under analysis.

## GetPackageOfData [v2]

Class method intended to request a package of data collected by the **PLUX** device.

```csharp
int[][] GetPackageOfData(bool rebootMemory)
```

### Description

After triggering the start of a real-time data acquisition streaming of sample values is continuously guaranteed through the established **Bluetooth** communication.

The **PluxDeviceManager** class ensures the storage of the received packages of data, being this getter the method used to access all packages of data from each one of the active channels. 

### Parameters

+	**rebootMemory** `bool`: When **true** the stored data inside **BufferedSamples** object is re-initialized.

### Returned Values

A 2D integer array, where each entry of the first dimension contains an array of integers that store all samples collected from the respective communication channel. 

The size of the first dimension is equal to the number of active channels.

## GetDetectableDevicesUnity

Class method intended to find the list of detectable devices through **Bluetooth** communication.
```csharp
void GetDetectableDevicesUnity(List<string> domains)
```

### Description

Internally the list of detected devices reaches `PluxDeviceManager.cs` in a string format, where each device mac-address is separated from each other by a "&" character.

`GetDetectableDevicesUnity` trigger the start of a Bluetooth scan in a parallel thread.

In `GetDetectableDevicesUnity` an automatic split of the received string took place, ensuring that a list with the available mac-addresses will be returned.

> **WARNING**
>
> To access the results of the previously started asynchronous task, a callback with the following format should be implemented in your application:
>
> `public void ScanResults(List<string> listDevices)`
